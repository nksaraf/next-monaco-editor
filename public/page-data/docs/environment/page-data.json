These execution environments come in one of two types:\nClient and Container.</p>\n<p>Client environments run entirely inside of your browser and will continue to\nbundle your code even when you lose your connection to our servers. Containers\non the other hand are executed server-side inside of a Docker container\ninstance.</p>\n<p>While Client Sandboxes have faster previews and offline availability, they lack\nin configurability. Container Sandboxes take longer to start up, but effectively\nbehave much like a local development environment, allowing you to customize your\nbuild tools, set up servers to listen to incoming requests, etc.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"client-environments\"><a href=\"#client-environments\" aria-label=\"client environments permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Client Environments</h2>\n<p>Client Sandboxes each have their own bundler attached to them which are\nconfigured to support a specific framework and emulate their official CLI tools.\nThey are not one-to-one implementations and thus don't support advanced\nconfiguration like custom webpack configurations or ejecting, however they are\ndesigned to mirror the default behavior of the framework. If your project\nrequires advanced configuration, try using a Container Sandbox instead.</p>\n<p>Currently it is not possible to convert a Client Sandbox to a Container Sandbox.\nSupport for this is on the roadmap, you can follow progress\n<a href=\"https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-client/issues/2111\">here</a>.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"container-environment\"><a href=\"#container-environment\" aria-label=\"container environment permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Container Environment</h2>\n<p>Container Sandboxes run by connecting to a Docker instance running on our\nservers. We use the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/node\">official Node docker image</a>\nin our container instances, meaning most Node packages should be supported out\nof the box. With Containers you can run your own bundlers such as Webpack and\nretain full control over its configuration.</p>\n<p>Containers also support running NPM scripts defined in your <code class=\"language-text\">package.json</code>. We\nrun a few of these scripts automatically to start up your server. See the list\nbelow for which scripts we run automatically and what their priority is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">dev</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">develop</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">serve</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">start</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While you can also lint your code using ESLint via the command line in\ncontainers, we don't currently support custom ESLint configs in the editor\nitself.</p>\n<p>Unlike Client Sandboxes, Containers also expose access to the Terminal, which\nallows you to run most commands you'd normally expect to be able to run in the\ncommand line. However, keep in mind that running certain commands which alter\nthe filesystem of the container instance will cause the files shown in the\nEditor to become out of sync, such as manually running <code class=\"language-text\">yarn add</code> or running\n<code class=\"language-text\">git</code> commands. We don't sync files and directories that are ignored via\n<code class=\"language-text\">.gitignore</code>, and there is a sync limit of 10 files per second and a maximum\nfile size of 2mb.</p>\n</section>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/environment"}}}
