Today's\nrelease is a beta of our new templates system, which we're planning to improve\nwith a bunch of useful new features over time.</p>\n<p>In this early beta release, you can quickly turn any existing sandbox into a\ntemplate with just one click. Let's take a look at how simple it is to get\nstarted with templates!</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-your-first-template\"><a href=\"#how-to-make-your-first-template\" aria-label=\"how to make your first template permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How to make your first Template</h2>\n<p>Creating a template from an existing sandbox is really easy! From an existing\nsandbox, pull up the editor and open up the <em>Project Info</em> workspace in the\nupper left corner. If you've just opened one of our official templates, first\nfork it and make some changes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/c38d88e960f5b4aa9d26b68448888a30/1.gif\" alt=\"Make Template from Sandbox\"></p>\n<p>You'll notice there's a new <em>Make Template</em> button. Click that and you'll see\nthat your newly created template has been frozen. This is to help prevent making\naccidental changes to the template whenever you open it from the <em>Dashboard</em> or\n<em>Create New Sandbox</em> modal. You can toggle this on and off in the <em>Project Info</em>\nworkspace of the template to make edits to the template itself.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/2b821e713e1cc0c23d741b0845ec3222/2.gif\" alt=\"Unfreeze\"></p>\n<p>You can also click on the color in the sidebar to change the color you assign to\nyour template. This is to help distinguish it in your <em>Dashboard</em> and in the\n<em>Create New Sandbox</em> modal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/f30399ea1d5c7373ac2a0e98f0cb399f/3.gif\" alt=\"Change Template Color\"></p>\n<p>You'll also notice that whenever you attempt to save changes to a frozen\nsandbox, a new modal will pop up asking you whether you would like to unfreeze\nit for editing or to fork it to create a new sandbox.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/6d4f0a09557d31c11358b23b05316d77/4.gif\" alt=\"Fork Sandbox Modal\"></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"using-templates\"><a href=\"#using-templates\" aria-label=\"using templates permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Using Templates</h2>\n<p>So now that you've created your first template, how can you use it? Just like\nthe official templates, you can create a new sandbox from one of your templates\nvia the <em>Create New Sandbox</em> modal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/32db4262714c9b92d74c238b58c287c5/5.gif\" alt=\"Use Template\"></p>\n<p>In the <em>Overview</em> tab, you'll see your most recently used templates up at the\ntop. Switching over to the My Templates tab, you can browse through all of your\ncustom templates. You'll also find all of your custom templates within the\nDashboard under the My Templates tab.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/08b41e532d1889691108433f8d8a263c/6.gif\" alt=\"My Templates\"></p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"teams\"><a href=\"#teams\" aria-label=\"teams permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Teams</h2>\n<p>As a team you can have your own templates as well! When you convert a sandbox\nowned by your team to a template you will be able to see them under <em>Team\nTemplates</em>. <em>Team Templates</em> are very useful for teams that want to have a\ncommon starting point for their team.</p>\n</section>\n<section>\n<h2 id=\"templates-roadmap\"><a href=\"#templates-roadmap\" aria-label=\"templates roadmap permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Templates Roadmap</h2>\n<p>We've got big plans to make templates even better and we'd love to hear your\nthoughts as you try them out! So what can you expect to see from templates in\nthe future?</p>\n<p>Templates are designed to save you time and effort making new sandboxes. But\nwouldn't it be great if you could share a boilerplate app featuring your newly\ndeveloped React library pre-configured and good to go? Have you ever visited the\n<em>Search</em> page and tried to find the perfect sandbox to start a new project with?\nWell we want to make that process a whole lot easier using templates!</p>\n<p>In the future you'll be able to make your templates public, which will list them\non a new <em>Community Templates</em> page where you'll be able to quickly search and\nfilter by keywords and dependencies. From there you'll be able to quickly view\nthe details of a template, including a live preview and a <code class=\"language-text\">README</code>, as well as\nlinks to a template's <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a> repository and issues page.\nYou'll be able to watch other user's public templates, which will add them to\nyour Create New Sandbox modal, allowing you to take advantage of what the\ncommunity creates.</p>\n<p>As we make the sandbox execution environment more configurable, we hope that\nit'll be easy for framework maintainers to easily add and manage their own\nofficial templates. By making templates completely open-source, we hope to make\nit easier to issue updates and bug fixes.</p>\n<p>There's a lot in the pipeline that we're eager to share with you! Thanks for\nusing CodeSandbox and we look forward to seeing all the awesome new things\nyou'll create!</p>\n</section>"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"id":"c4c3bf19-2599-55f0-bb53-7e88d7c1eb0f"}}}
